# Jay Kuang's Portfolio

A clean, responsive personal portfolio built with Vanilla JS and Tailwind CSS. All content is dynamically managed via `content.json`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Update Content**: Edit `content.json` to customize your profile, experience, skills, and projects.
2. **Setup Contact Form**: Create a form at [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) and add your endpoint URL to the `action` field in `content.json`.
   - **Security Tip**: To protect your unique endpoint URL, go to your Formspree form settings and add your domain to the **"Restrict to Domain"** list. This ensures only your website can send emails through your form. 
3. **Resume**: Replace `Jay_Kuang-Resume.pdf` with your own PDF and update the path in `content.json` if needed.
